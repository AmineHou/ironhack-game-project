        Dungeon Maze (Demo) is a text-based Interactive Fiction where you are trapped in a dungeon and need to escape.
        You need to explore the different rooms, find items and give them to NPCs you encounter in order to find the
        key that opens the Dungeon entrance and escape.<br>
        Be careful, some of the rooms are trapped and will lead you to certain death!
